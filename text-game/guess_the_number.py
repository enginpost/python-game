#  1. The range selectable as a difficulty: easy = 1-25, medium = 1-50, hard = 1-100
#  2. Player gets 5 guesses to determine the number
#  3. At each chance, the guesses are displayed and the user is told if
#     the guess is high or low
#  4. Player can exit the game at any time by typing "exit"
#  5. Player is given the opportunity to play again at the end of the game.
